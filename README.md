# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description
This Project displays a list of puppies all competing in a 'Puppy Bowl'. The puppies details (ie. name, breed, team, etc.) are presented when the 'More Details' button is clicked. A form is offered that allows the user to add puppies and a search bar for effortlessly searching for specific puppies.
